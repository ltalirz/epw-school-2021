     Parallel version (MPI & OpenMP), running on       1 processor cores
     Number of MPI processes:                 1
     Threads/MPI process:                     1

     MPI processes distributed on     1 nodes

     Reading xml data from directory:

     ./sic.save/
     file C.UPF: wavefunction(s)  3d renormalized

     IMPORTANT: XC functional enforced from input :
     Exchange-correlation= PZ
                           (   1   1   0   0   0   0   0)
     Any further DFT definition will be discarded
     Please, verify this is what you really want
